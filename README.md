I've been playing a lot of half life lately and wanted to make a gravity gun. So I did, and got carried away. Plus, this is probably a good stress test for your PC.
## Controls
Think of it as extremely cheap Half Life 2,  or GMod. The controls are the same. With the addition of a reset button set to R.
## Notes
You are not allowed to take any assets used in this repository. I'm good with code, but not the assets.
